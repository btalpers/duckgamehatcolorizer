# duckgamehatcolorizer

Automatically generates team-specific hats based off a base hat.

Requires Python 2.7 (untested with 3) and the latest PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Drop your initial hat (likely white) in the same directory as `colorizer.py`, and edit `filename` in `colorizer.py` to your hat `png`. 

Currently, the first 20 lines of `colorizer.py` are written to be fairly easily configurable, if you decided to add extra colors or change which colors are input/output. I added black and purple as custom output examples.
